        <h2>What Is User Experience/ User Interface Design?</h2>
        <article>Every time you interact with a mobile app, use the internet, or visit a website data is generated. Every day large amounts of data are generated from millions of users, and nearly all of this data is valuable.
            Understanding the data generated by customers leads to data-driven insights on products and services. As these swaths of data prove to be ever more useful to businesses, the demand for qualified professionals to handle and understand this data will only continue to grow.

        <h2>What Does A User Experience/ User Interface Designer Do?</h2>
        <article>Data scientists are responsible for collecting and analyzing data produced by a program or system. They develop custom algorithms and build models to produce valuable insights from trends in this data. Data scientists will then use      these insights to solve problems within an organization.
            For example, a data scientist could use information about user preferences to recommend products a user may want to buy on an e-commerce site. Data scientists could also take user interaction data from an app to find ways to make the app’s UX more user friendly.
            Data scientists will do more than just analyze data. They have to derive insights from a dataset and present these findings to other departments. If a data scientist finds out users do not go ahead with buying products they have put in their basket, they’ll have to figure out why and tell the engineering and design teams so they can improve the user experiences.
